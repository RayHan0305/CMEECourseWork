# My CMEE Coursework Repository For Week3-Biological Computing in R

## code
1. **.Rhistory**
It stores the commands that i typed in the R console which lets R remember what i have done in the previous session.

2. **basic_io.R**
It is a simple script to illustrate R input-output. Using the data 'trees.csv'. It will create the file 'MyData.csv'

3. **.RData**
It contains all the data loaded and created in R, including outputs of statistical analyses and other things.

4. **MyResults.Rout**
THis file contains all the output.

5. **control_flow.R**
sample codes of 'if statements', 'for loops', 'while loops'

6. **break.R**
Sample codes of 'break' out of a loop 

7. **next.R**
This code checks if a number is odd using the "modulo" operation and prints it if it is. (skip to next iteration of a loop)

8. **boilerplate.R**
Sample codes of R functions

9. **TreeHeight.R**
The function calculates heights of trees given distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top, using the trigonometric formula.

10. **Vectorize1.R**
This code 


## data
1. **trees.csv**
Including data about those trees'Species, Distance.m, Angle.degrees
## results
1. **MyData.csv**
Save the data frames using 'write.table', including data from 'trees.csv'.
