#3 Count the sequence length of this genome
tail -n +2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | wc -c

#4 Count the matches of a particular sequence, “ATGC” in the genome of E. coli (hint: Start by removing the first line and removing newline characters)
tail -n +2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "ATGC" | wc -l

#5 Compute the AT/GC ratio. That is, the (A+T)/(G+C) ratio (as a single number). This is a summary measure of base composition of double-stranded DNA. DNA from different organisms and lineages has different ratios of the A-to-T and G-to-C base pairs (google “Chargaff’s rule”). For example, DNA from organisms that live in hot springs have a higher GC content, the GC base pair is more thermally stable.
